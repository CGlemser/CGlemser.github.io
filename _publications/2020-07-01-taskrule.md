*We characterized layer-specific, spatiotemporal synaptic population activity with chronic, laminar current source density analysis in Mongolian gerbils trained in an auditory decision-making Go-NoGo shuttle-box task. Using generalized linear mixed-effect models, we found a layer-specific and multiplexed representation of the task rule, action selection and the animal's behavioral options as accumulating evidence in preparation of correct choices.*
