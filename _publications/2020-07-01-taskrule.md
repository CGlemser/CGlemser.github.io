In an auditory decision-making Go/NoGo shuttle-box task with Mongolian gerbils, we demonstrate that not only sensory but also task- and choice-related information is represented in the mesoscopic neuronal population code of the primary auditory cortex (A1). Based on <i>generalized linear-mixed effect models</i> we found a layer-specific and multiplexed representation of the task rule, action selection, and the animal’s behavioral options as accumulating evidence in preparation of correct choices. The findings expand our understanding of how individual layers contribute to the integrative circuit in the sensory cortex in order to code task-relevant information and guide sensorybased decision-making.
