**Welcome to my homepage!**

------------------------------

My name is Claudia Glemser, I'm a student in a statistics masters program at the Otto von Guericke University Mageburg in Germany and a proclaimed serial hobbyist. My current obsession include houseplants, stitching and bullet journaling.

On this website I will share cool finds, epiphanies and projects on all things statistics and data science as well as updates on my indoor jungle and creative projects. If you're interested in updates, feel free to bookmark this page. You'll find my publications, my CV and blogposts on stats and hobby stuff! Enjoy :)
